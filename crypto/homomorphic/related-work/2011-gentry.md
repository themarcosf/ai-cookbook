Title: Implementing Gentry’s Fully-Homomorphic Encryption Scheme

- Smart and Vercauteren implemented the underlying “somewhat homomorphic” scheme, but were not able to implement the bootstrapping functionality that is needed to get the complete scheme to work

- Once the degree of polynomials that can be evaluated by the scheme exceeds the degree of the decryption polynomial (times two), the scheme is called “bootstrappable”
