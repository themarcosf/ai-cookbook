Title: Survey on Fully Homomorphic Encryption, Theory, and Applications

> 7.b

- Neural networks can be thought of as a generalization of regression to present elaborate relationships between high dimensional input data and output data. Privacy-preserving machine learning with neural networks has been addressed by multiple research efforts, even though computational complexity remains a challenge especially when neural networks are used for training over encrypted data.

> 7.d

- While considerable advances have been achieved, privacy-preserving neural networks using homomorphic encryption still suffer from high computational complexity, low efficiencies, and inadequacy of deployment in real world scenarios. Further research is required to develop efficient frameworks enabling training and evaluation of complex neural networks over encrypted data or encrypted neural networks trained over plaintext data. Research directions could include:
  - Algorithmic improvements: this includes (i) usage of pre-trained models to reduce computational complexity during the training phase, (ii) approximation of activation functions using polynomials, etc.
