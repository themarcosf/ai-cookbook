        "### 3. Homomorphic encryption\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective of using homomorphic encryption ($\\varepsilon$) is that, given an algorithm ${\\text{Evaluate}_\\varepsilon}$ and a valid public key $\\text{pk}$, a computation can be performed on any circuit $\\text{C}$ (*i.e.*, a collection of logic gates used to compute a function) and any cyphertexts $\\psi_i \\leftarrow \\text{Encrypt}_{\\varepsilon}(\\text{pk}, \\pi_i)$, such that the output of the computation is an encryption of $\\psi \\leftarrow \\text{Evaluate}_{\\varepsilon}(\\text{pk}, \\mathcal{C}, \\psi_1, \\dots, \\psi_t)$ and that $\\text{Decrypt}_{\\varepsilon}(\\text{sk}, \\psi) = \\mathcal{C}(\\pi_1, \\dots, \\pi_t)$ for a valid secret key $\\text{sk}$, as first described by (1978, Rivest). The first viable construction of a fully homomorphic encryption scheme was proposed by (Gentry, 2009) and may be broken down into three major conceptual steps:\n",
        "  - a *\"somewhat homomorphic\"* scheme, supporting evaluation of low-degree polynomials on encrypted data;\n",
        "  - a *\"squashing\"* decryption mechanism, responsible for expressing outputs as low-degree polynomials supported by the scheme, and;\n",
        "  - a *\"bootstrapping\"* transformation, a self-referential property that makes the depth of the decryption circuit shallower than what the scheme can handle.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gentry's main insight was to use bootstrapping in order to obtain a scheme that could evaluate polynomials of high-enough degrees while keeping the decryption procedure expressed as polynomials of low-enough degrees, so that the degrees of the polynomials evaluated by the scheme could surpass the degrees of the polynomials decrypted by the scheme (Gentry, 2011). This scheme used **\"ideal lattices\"**, corresponding to ideals in polynomial rings, to perform homomorphic operations. The reason for this is that ideal lattices inherit natural addition and multiplication properties from the ring, which allows for homomorphic operations to be performed on encrypted data. We defer the discussion on ideal lattices to the next section, since these operations are performed in the context of neural networks in our case.\n",
        "\n",
        "Several implementations of homomorphic encryption schemes have been developed since, including DGHV (Dijk, 2010), BGV (Brakerski, 2011) and BFV (Fan-Vercauteren, 2012), with varying levels of security and efficiency. In 2016, Cheon *et al.* introduced HEANN (a.k.a. CKKS), which is a variant of the BFV scheme designed for computations on real numbers. This scheme is also particularly well-suited for neural network evaluation, where each layer is composed of several matrix vector multiplications and activation functions that can have their inputs approximated by encrypted floating-point polynomials.\n",
        "\n",
        "Following the methodology adopted by (Gentry, 2011), we derive a scheme from HEANN capable of performing inference on encrypted data when applied to neural networks. The main idea is to encode a message $\\pi$ into a plaintext polynomial $m$ and encrypt it using a public key $\\text{pk}$ to obtain a ciphertext $\\text{Enc}(m, \\nu)$. In this scheme, $\\nu$ stands for the *noise parameter* attached to each polynomial $m$ such that the noise is less than some threshold $\\Nu \\gg \\nu$, as proposed by (Gentry, 2009). This *noise budget* is a critical parameter in the scheme and is inserted to guarantee the security of hardness assumptions such as LWE, RLWE and NTRU(citations). In this sense, it determines the security level of the encryption and the scheme is designed to ensure that the noise budget is not exceeded at any point during the computation.\n",

        "\n",
        "As in (Cheon, 2016), \"it is inevitable to encrypt a vector of multiple plaintexts in a single ciphertext for efficient homomorphic computation\" (p.3), being the plaintext space usually a cyclotomic ring $\\mathbb{Z}_t[X]/(\\Phi_M(X))$ of a finite characteristic. Thus, after being encoded by a native plaintext space, *ie.* the canonical embedding map, the plaintext polynomial ($m, \\nu$) is encrypted using the public key $\\text{pk}$ to obtain the ciphertext $\\text{Enc}(m, \\nu)$. We use a *probabilistic public key encryption* scheme so that the encryption function is randomized, such that the same plaintext polynomial $m$ can be encrypted into different ciphertexts $\\text{Enc}(m, \\nu)$ for different instances of the model, and encryption can be performed by anyone with access to the public key $\\text{pk}$, enabling the model to consume data encrypted by any party.\n",

        "The encrypted data can then be used to perform computations as it is fed into the neural network. Considering the approximate arithmetic nature of our base scheme, the *noise parameter* is treated as part of error during approximate downstream matrix operations. In this sense, consider that the encryption $\\mathbf{c}$ of message $\\pi$ by the public key $\\text{pk}$ will have a structure of the form $\\langle \\mathbf{c}, \\text{pk} \\rangle = m + \\nu$, where $\\nu$ must be large enough to mask any significant features of message $\\pi$ while not exceeding the noise budget $\\Nu$. Therefore, for a noise budget of $0 \\leq \\nu \\leq \\Nu$, each element of the output vector of the base neural network contains an embedded Gaussian distributed error $\\nu'$ such that $|\\nu'| \\leq \\Nu$.\n",

The decryption function is also designed to ensure that the noise parameter $\\nu'$ is removed from the decrypt plaintext polynomial $m'$ during decryption.\n",

As observed by (Marcolla, 2022), privacy-preserving neural networks tend to suffer from high computational complexity and low efficiencies, as the computational complexity of training neural networks is generally high. By avoiding the need of training on encrypted data, we can reduce the computational complexity of the model and improve its efficiency.\n",

This layer is designed to approximate a soft argmax function in the encrypted domain, allowing the neural network to perform prediction without leaking any intermediate values. By being differentiable, it also allows the use of backpropagation to calibrate the logits before ingestion by the softmax function, adding additional noise $\\nu$ to the intermediate output of the base model, while effectively keeping it below the *noise budget* $\\Nu \\gg \\nu$.\n",

As proposed by Gentry, the public key $\\text{pk}$ contains an ideal $I$ and a plaintext space $\\mathcal{P}$, consisting of cosets of the ideal $I$ in the ring $R$, while the secret key $\\text{sk}$ corresponds to a short ideal $I$ in $R$. To encrypt $\\pi \\in \\mathcal{P}$, the encrypter performs $\\psi \\xleftarrow{{R}} \\pi + I$, where $I$ represents the noise parameter.

        "HEANN supports approximate addition and multiplication of encrypted messages by truncating a ciphertext into a smaller modulus, which leads to rounding of plaintext and also adds noise to the message. The main purpose of the noise is for security reasons and, given the nature of the scheme, it ends up being reduced during computation due to rescaling. As the authors explain (p. 6), \"the most important feature of our scheme is the rounding operation of plaintexts\". The output of this scheme, therefore, is an approximate value with a predetermined precision.\n",

        "As per the scheme definition, given the set of complex numbers $\\mathbb{H} = \\left\\{ (z_j)_{j \\in \\mathbb{Z}_M^*} : z_{-j} = \\overline{z_j}, \\ \\forall j \\in \\mathbb{Z}_M^* \\right\\} \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{\\Phi(M)}$ and the subgroup ${T}$ of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{Z}_M^*$ satisfying $\\mathbb{Z}_M^*/T = \\{\\pm 1\\}$, the input of the scheme is a plaintext polynomial constituted by elements of a cyclotomic ring ${R} = \\mathbb{Z}_t[X]/(\\Phi_M(X))$, which is mapped to a vector of complex numbers via an embedding map represented by a ring homomorphism. This transformation enables the preservation of the precision of the plaintext after encoding. The decoding procedure is almost the inverse of the encoding, except for the addition of a round-off algorithm for discretization. An important characteristic of HEANN that makes it suitable for neural networks is that the bit size of ciphertext modulus does not grow exponentially in relation to the circuit being evaluated, which allows for the evaluation of deep neural networks without the need for bootstrapping.\n",
